# Let me expand on converting the rest of the functionalities into a complete PyQt6 application. Here's an overview:

# ### Functionalities to Cover:
# 1. **Add Guest**:
#    - Create input fields for guest name and contact.
#    - Add a button to save the guest to the database.

# 2. **Make Reservation**:
#    - Include fields for guest ID, room ID, check-in, and check-out dates.
#    - Add validation to ensure correct data is entered.
#    - Save the reservation using the `make_reservation` method.

# 3. **Check Available Rooms**:
#    - Display a table listing all available rooms.
#    - Fetch the data using `get_available_rooms` from the database.

# 4. **Check In**:
#    - Input field for room ID.
#    - Update the room status to "occupied."

# 5. **Check Out**:
#    - Input field for room ID.
#    - Update the room status to "available."

# 6. **Main Window Navigation**:
#    - Use `QTabWidget` or a menu-based navigation system for organizing these functionalities.
